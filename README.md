jQuery Explosion plugin
========================

Make images explode out of something when you click on it. Because minimalist
design is for sissies.

See index.html for usage. See it in action at
<http://bhuga.github.com/jquery-explosion-coffee/>

Lots of inspiration came from
<https://github.com/atomantic/jquery.imgExplosion>. I also stole his star
picture for the example. Thanks.
